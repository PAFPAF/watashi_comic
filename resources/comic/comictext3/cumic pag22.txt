"the rest of that morning ( a morning with free time, a free time morning) (so free that i felt like a whole month was passing) was nice, he kept asking me questions about life and about my job, i dont ever think about stuff like that, so it was good to hear what another person mind is like, i don't care if he came from a mirror, he is still... a friend... he feels like a friend, and i think this is the first time i am felling this happy.. maybe i am hopeless but that's the price to pay for being friends with someone who could be a demon"<br />
君: So, i think about making a game for us to play<br />
私: a game?<br />
君: yeah you are going to be crazy when you hear about it, there is not much stuff in your house so i had to come up with something creative<br />
私: oh, go ahead..!<br />
君: i found a workcase next to your carpet, so i had an ideia of a little game we can play
