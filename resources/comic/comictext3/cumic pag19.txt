君: HEY! tell me you, why is anxiety such a modern problem?<br />
私: i don't know, i don't have TIME to think about things like that but now i got time so i may think for something to answer (i am going to answer you in this case)<br />
私: .......................ok, i used all my braincells (it took two minutes) i am "sorry" i can't answer you (you, in this case)<br />
君: anxiety is such a modern problem because we don't have full control of our lifes anymore, no one knows what they want to do or make, or be, everything just seems so complicated, working is always so stressfull, studying is always so stressfull, you know, in the old days our whole life was planned and we didn't have to worry with much, but now the game is a lot diferent don't you think?<br />
君: uhm... yes... (yes)<br />
私: you may not understand a word of what i am saying, but all i am asking is a solution for this "Problem"<br />
私: uhm.... i don't know, if there is a solution or what... I DON'T like to think about that kind of stuff, but i think you just have to work hard enough and make all of that stress pay off, i think that nowadays you have a lot of freedom to do whatever you want you just have to work hard enough, maybe selling your soul in the process
