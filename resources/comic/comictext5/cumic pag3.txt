私: boss, do you still hear me?<br>
君: yes, 私<br>
私: i see, finally.... i don't know why but something tells me that i should be scared... run away... but i am just so.... comfortable
you know boss, we have a lot in common, you are the person i look fordward to<br>
君: i think so too<br>
私: so... what do you want to tell me? after all?<br>
君: your time is over<br>
私: is it?<br>
君: your time is over, and it's time for you to wake up<br>
私: wake up? what do you mean, i am living the best normal life, right?<br>
君: no, this is just the reality you created, 私, you never wanted to grow up, did you? you feel stuck in a maze, right?<br>
私: yeah.. i guess, but what can i do about it? i just need to keep going, tho i (at the same time) feel like i am creating all of this. Things should be going right but..
shouldn't i be helping myself instead? so why is everything being so wrong, so weird..<br>
君: don't ask me, you are the only one who can answer that<br>
私: but i can't find the answer, i don't know if i will ever find the answer, i don't know if i am capable of accepting my trueself, (i am lying to myself about the "best normal life" right? about the best job, the best boss) i thought i was going on with a happy life, but everything is falling apart, yet, i don't want to give up<br>
君: i think the only thing you can do now to fix all of that is to accept your trueself, your self that lives on "the otherside" the version that is ruining your life all this time
